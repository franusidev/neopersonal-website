# Kubernetes Best Practices for DevOps

Running Kubernetes in production requires following established best practices to ensure **reliability**, **security**, and **scalability**.

## Resource Management

### CPU and Memory Limits

Always set resource requests and limits for your containers:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
spec:
  containers:
  - name: app
    image: nginx
    resources:
      requests:
        memory: "64Mi"
        cpu: "250m"
      limits:
        memory: "128Mi"
        cpu: "500m"
```

### Why This Matters

> Setting proper resource limits prevents containers from consuming all available resources and impacting other workloads on the same node.

## Security Best Practices

1. **Use non-root containers** whenever possible
2. **Implement Pod Security Standards**
3. **Regular security scanning** of container images
4. **Network policies** for traffic isolation

### Network Policy Example

```yaml
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: NetworkPolicy
metadata:
  name: deny-all
spec:
  podSelector: {}
  policyTypes:
  - Ingress
  - Egress
```

## Monitoring and Observability

Essential monitoring components:

- **Prometheus** for metrics collection
- **Grafana** for visualization
- **Jaeger** for distributed tracing
- **ELK Stack** for centralized logging

## Key Takeaways

- Always use resource limits
- Implement proper security measures
- Monitor everything
- Test your disaster recovery procedures

*Remember: The best practices are only as good as their implementation!*
