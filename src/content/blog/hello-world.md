# Hello World - Welcome to My Journey

Welcome to my blog! I'm thrilled you've found your way here. This isn't just another "Hello World" post—it's the beginning of a journey where I'll share my experiences, learnings, and passion for technology with you.

## About Me

I'm a DevOps and Cloud Engineer with a deep passion for automation, infrastructure, and building scalable systems. My journey in technology has taken me through various roles and projects, from managing complex cloud infrastructures to implementing CI/CD pipelines that transform how teams deploy software.

### My Background

- **DevOps Engineering**: Extensive experience with code management, containerization, orchestration, and deployment automation
- **Cloud Platforms**: Proficient in AWS, Azure
- **Infrastructure as Code**: deep knowledge of tools like Terraform, Kubernetes and ArgoCD
- **Automation**: Building robust CI/CD pipelines with GitHub Actions, Azure DevOps
- **Monitoring & Observability**: Implementing comprehensive monitoring solutions

## Why This Blog?

I've created this space for several reasons:

1. **Knowledge Sharing**: Technology moves fast, and I believe in sharing what I learn along the way
2. **Community Building**: Connecting with fellow engineers, developers, and tech enthusiasts
3. **Documentation**: Recording solutions to problems I've solved for future reference
4. **Teaching**: Breaking down complex concepts into digestible, practical guides

### What You'll Find Here

Expect a mix of technical content and personal insights:

- **DevOps Tutorials**: Step-by-step guides on automation, deployment, and best practices
- **Infrastructure as Code**: Real-world examples and patterns for managing infrastructure
- **Cloud Architecture**: Designing scalable, resilient systems in the cloud
- **Automation Scripts**: Practical tools and scripts to streamline your workflow
- **Career Insights**: Lessons learned and advice for fellow engineers
- **Project Showcases**: Deep dives into interesting projects and their implementations

## My Technology Stack

Here's a glimpse of the tools and technologies I work with regularly:

### Cloud & Infrastructure
```yaml
Cloud Providers:
  - AWS (EC2, Lambda, RDS, S3, Elastic Beansktalk, EKS...)
  - Microsoft Azure (App Service, AKS, Functions)

Infrastructure as Code:
  - Terraform
  - Bicep
```

### DevOps & Automation
```yaml
CI/CD Platforms:
  - GitHub Actions

  - Helm & Customize
  - Docker Compose

Monitoring:
  - Prometheus
  - Grafana
  - Azure Monitor
```

## What's Coming Next

I have several exciting topics planned for upcoming posts:

1. **"Building Your First Terraform Module"** - A comprehensive guide to creating reusable infrastructure components
2. **"Kubernetes Deployment Strategies"** - Exploring blue-green, canary, and rolling deployments
3. **"Monitoring Microservices"** - Setting up observability for distributed systems
4. **"CI/CD Best Practices"** - Lessons from implementing pipelines across different organizations

## A Real-World Example

Let me share something more practical than the typical "Hello World". Here's a Terraform configuration that sets up a basic web application infrastructure on Azure:

```hcl
# Provider configuration
terraform {
  required_providers {
    azurerm = {
      source  = "hashicorp/azurerm"
      version = "~> 3.0"
    }
  }
}

provider "azurerm" {
  features {}
}

# Resource Group
resource "azurerm_resource_group" "rg-webapp-example" {
  name     = "rg-hello-world"
  location = "East US"

  tags = {
    Environment = "development"
    Project     = "hello-world"
  }
}

# Virtual Network
resource "azurerm_virtual_network" "rg-webapp-example" {
  name                = "vnet-hello-world"
  address_space       = ["10.0.0.0/16"]
  location            = azurerm_resource_group.rg-webapp-example.location
  resource_group_name = azurerm_resource_group.rg-webapp-example.name

  tags = {
    Environment = "development"
  }
}

# Subnet
resource "azurerm_subnet" "internal" {
  name                 = "subnet-internal"
  resource_group_name  = azurerm_resource_group.rg-webapp-example.name
  virtual_network_name = azurerm_virtual_network.rg-webapp-example.name
  address_prefixes     = ["10.0.2.0/24"]
}

# App Service Plan
resource "azurerm_service_plan" "rg-webapp-example" {
  name                = "asp-hello-world"
  resource_group_name = azurerm_resource_group.rg-webapp-example.name
  location            = azurerm_resource_group.rg-webapp-example.location
  os_type             = "Linux"
  sku_name            = "B1"

  tags = {
    Environment = "development"
  }
}

# App Service
resource "azurerm_linux_web_app" "rg-webapp-example" {
  name                = "app-hello-world-${random_id.suffix.hex}"
  resource_group_name = azurerm_resource_group.rg-webapp-example.name
  location            = azurerm_service_plan.rg-webapp-example.location
  service_plan_id     = azurerm_service_plan.rg-webapp-example.id

  site_config {
    application_stack {
      node_version = "18-lts"
    }
  }

  tags = {
    Environment = "development"
  }
}

# Random suffix for unique naming
resource "random_id" "suffix" {
  byte_length = 4
}
```

This is the kind of practical, real-world content you can expect from this blog.
